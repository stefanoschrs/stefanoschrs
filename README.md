👨‍💻 I wrote my first lines of code at 12 and never stopped. For more than a decade, I’ve been building products across Web and Mobile — from scrappy prototypes to large-scale systems.  
🔧 My experience spans Frontend, Backend, Hardware, DevOps, and everything in between. I thrive at the intersection where code meets real-world impact.  
⚡ I work best in my favorite playground: Angular, React Native, JavaScript, Node.js, Go, Linux, AWS. But at the end of the day, tools are just tools — I pick the right ones for the job.  
🤖 I have a passion for scripting and automation — if it can be automated, it will be.  
🔐 Security isn’t an afterthought for me; it’s a core mindset I bring into every project.
